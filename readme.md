# Utility Tracker

The initial thoughts of this project was to send a notification to my company @intellectstorm a message that I have power outage. As I went on developing the project, I then realize I can track the power outages or irregularities of GPL and GTT using the blaze modem. This repo includes the frontend and backend source code of how I implemented this.
